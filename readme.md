# General

In this work we  use Dreem headband data to perform sleep stage scoring on 30 seconds epochs of biophysiological signals.
This work is  a part of an in-class [Kaggle Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dreem-sleep-stages) for the Machine
Learning Course offered at Ecole CentraleSupelec, Paris in the Fall 2018-2019.



Our final F-score is 64.78 % on the private test set and we are currently ranked 4th / 74.
